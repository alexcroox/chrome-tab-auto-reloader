# Chrome Tab Auto Reloader Extension

Auto reload a tab every 30 seconds to keep your session alive while you are AFK

## Motivation üçï

It's Friday night and you've crept out of the babies room to order a pizza. You get spend ages creating your order, including your wife's multiple topping changes, and add to the basket.

Just as you're about to checkout the baby starts screaming... You go to calm her down, and 20 minutes later return to checkout. Disaster strikes, your basket session has timed out and you've got to start all over again. üò©

I wish I could think of a better use case to explain why this plugin might come in handy, but the above is the reality of my situation and I built it purely for this use case...

## Installing

Install from the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-tab-auto-reloader/ipakeehlnakodkfgpgdelphdafpcjajk)

Click the new reload icon in your extension toolbar and start the auto reload from the popup. To stop the auto reload press the button again or you click away from the popup and when it closes the timer will stop.
